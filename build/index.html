                  <p>I&rsquo;m fortunate enough that I get to work with Dan Denney. He is one of my favorite people on this planet.</p>
                  
                  <p>The story I like to always tell that illustrates this is his encounter with HTML emails. I&rsquo;m sure all of us here know how painful they are. You have to code in tables, use inline styles, and it&rsquo;s just generally not fun. All of our front-end developers just get in, do them, and get out. However, not for Dan Denney. Instead of pushing through and moving on, what did he do? He made our HTML emails awesome, pushed the technology, and now wears the crown of &ldquo;HTML Email King.&rdquo;</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>He&rsquo;s truly a saint, and everyone needs to know that.</strong></p>

                  <p>In all seriousness, though, I love this conference. I&#39;ve only missed it once, and I look forward to it every year. The Denney family does a tremendous job, and I’m super pumped to be here, and to be speaking to all of you.</p>

                  <p>I really want to explore the thought process behind writing modular CSS. We&rsquo;ve
                  talked a lot about the &ldquo;how&rdquo; of things like object-oriented CSS (and other CSS
                  methodologies), but we haven&rsquo;t really talked about the process that we take to
                  get there.</p>
                  
                  <p>It&rsquo;s something that we see with new front-end developers that we teach our
                  system to. They understand how we structure things, what we call certain
                  elements, how we organize our CSS, but how we get there, the thought process,
                  is the tough part to teach.</p>
