    The name of this talk is *"Thinking Modular CSS."* Before we get started, I’d
    like to take a moment and talk about **Dan Denney**.

    In all seriousness, though, I love this conference. I've only missed it
    once, and I look forward to it every year. The Denney family does a
    tremendous job, and I’m super pumped to be here, and to be speaking to all
    of you.

    And as proof that I’ve been here before, here is a picture of me from last
    year. Funny story: in our company chatroom, if you use the word
    "unimpressed", this picture shows up because, apparently, I look
    unimpressed.

    However, I think I was more just in awe while looking at all the bacon.

    So what am I hear to talk about? This talk is called, "Thinking Modular
    CSS". What does that mean?

    Before we get into that, I want to give you some information about me.  I'm
    **Drew Barontini**. You can find me on Twitter, or most places on the
    Internet, [@drewbarontini](http://twitter.com/drewbarontini).


    I do say "most places on the internet" because I use that handle
    *everywhere*. If I'm on the service, that's my username.
