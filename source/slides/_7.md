I really want to explore the thought process behind building writing
modular CSS. We've talked a lot about the "how" of things like
object-oriented CSS (and other CSS methodologies), but we haven't really
talked about the process that we take to get there.

It's something that we see with new front-end developers that we teach our
system to. They understand how we structure things, what we call certain
elements, how we organize our CSS, but how we get there, the thought
process, is the tough part to teach.
